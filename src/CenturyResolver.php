     * no fixture used a ten-digit coordination number, so golden:check was green
     * throughout.
     *
     * The nullable month and day are the partial-identity case, and they need the
     * same rule for a different reason: with the month unknown there is no date
     * to compare, and the earliest one the digits allow is the only candidate
     * that cannot wrongly push a real bearer back a century.
